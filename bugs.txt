-A user searches for a group and selects a group to join. If a user in the group
indicates that this group is not open to join after the user seraches for the group,
the request will still go through even when the invite is sent after the group
indicates that it is unavailable.

-Likewise if a group searches for users and selects a user to send a request to,
if the user marks themselves as unavailable before the request is sent, the
request will still be sent.

-If the last member of a group invites a user but leaves the group, causing the group
to have no members left, the user will still receive and be able to click on the invitation.
This appears to recreate the group, with only the first member within.

-Removing a course still goes through even when the user has groups in the course that they're in.

-In the same manner a user can still recieve requests even if they remove the course that
they've been invited to. Accepting this invitation adds back the course.

-Check that the urls properly redirect to the actual url (not add_course, create_group, etc.)
(Most have been fixed, just make sure all functions are like this).

-A user can simultaneously be logged in at two locations at the same time, and end up
with overlap. Make sure only one session can be opened at a time per user, probably
by logging out the first instance of the user.

-Simultaneous editing of descriptions is problematic, they don't update
at the same time for all users. When refreshed, changes to the most recently
pushed update.
