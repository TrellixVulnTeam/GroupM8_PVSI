    <P>
      Have you ever found yourself in a course populated by a sea of strangers?
      Between questions of competency and sheer awkwardness, it can be nearly
      impossible to reach out and find study groups. That's where GroupM8 comes in.
      GroupM8 is a free web application that lets students find study groups for
      their courses with ease through an intuitive interface. Students
      can search through study groups and request to join them with a click of a
      button. On the other end of that request, any member of a group can approve
      members. Once in a group, students can schedule study sessions through a
      simple event system  without leaving
      the group’s customizable homepage. You can leave a group or toggle which
      courses you’re looking for groups in with a single click. Courses can be
      added or dropped from your course list on your personal homepage, where you
      can also make your own group in the time it takes to send a text message.
      Group members can view all students looking for groups in the relevant course,
      making finding more people for your group a breeze. All you need to sign up is
      your netid and password.
