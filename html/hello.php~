		<h3 align="center">Elevator Speech</h3>
		<p align="justify">Have you ever found yourself in a course populated by a sea of strangers? Between questions 
		   of competency and sheer awkwardness, it can be nearly impossible to reach out and find 
		   study groups. That's where GroupM8 comes in. GroupM8 is a free web application that lets 
		   students find study groups for their courses with ease through an intuitive minimalist interface. 
		   Students can search through study groups and request to join them with a click of a button. On 
		   the other end of that request, any member of a group can approve members. Once in a group,
		   students can schedule study sessions through a simple event system and chat with other group 
		   members, all without leaving the group’s customizable homepage. You can leave a group or 
		   toggle which courses you’re looking for groups in with a single click. Courses can be added or 
		   dropped from your course list on your personal homepage, where you can also make your own 
		   group in the time it takes to send a text message. Group members can view all students looking 
		   for groups in the relevant course, making finding more people for your group a breeze. All you 
		   need to sign up is your netid and password.
